More in here later, but for the moment..

Don't forget to make a .bashrc file
use the $PATH command to find the correct diretory to insert the file
file should look something like PATH=${PATH}:${HOME}/gitdev/chipper/bin
this will allow chipper scripts (such as pull-all.sh) to be run from anywhere in git-bash
