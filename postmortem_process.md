Note: This template is still under development & discussion and is not ready for general usage.

 - [ ]  **1. Schedule the meeting.**
 - Require the entire sim team to participate, and optionally anyone else who had a significant involvement. Have the meeting as soon as possible after the sim is released, so that experiences are still fresh in everyone's mind. Allow sufficient time for the meeting, 1.5-2 hours.

 - [ ]  2. Enlist a meeting moderator. 
 - This should be someone who was not on the team and has no vested interest in the sim. The moderator's job is to make sure the meeting runs efficiently, stays on point, and doesn't become overly negative. The moderator also documents the meeting, or you can enlist an additional person (not one of the participants) to be the secretary. Do not record the meeting.

 - [ ]  3. Two successes and iwo improvements
 - Require participants to bring a list of no more than 2 items that were done well during the project and no more than 2 items that could be improved upon. Limiting to 2 requires people to think critically about their experience.

 - [ ]  4. Identifying the top five 
 - At the meeting, start by going around the room and having each person present their items (successes, then improvements). Make a list of these items, and note duplicates. Based on popularity, identify the top 5 success items and the top 5 items that need improvement.

    Discuss the 5 success items first. Identify specific things that can be applied to future sims. Celebrate, pat each other on the back. Then move on to the harder part.

    Discuss the 5 improvement items. Try to avoid getting personal. Discuss what was learned, and identify specific things that can be done to prevent these problems in the future. If anything needs more investigation, assign to specific individuals.

    Identify modifications to the PhET Look-&-Feel Guidelines. Based on what we learned during development of this sim, how should the guidelines be revised?

    Review the "Sim completing checklist" here: https://phet.unfuddle.com/a#/projects/9404/notebooks/17977/pages/105244/latest

    Create a postmortem report, capturing all of the above. Modify any other documents (design, implementation, etc.) to reflect decisions made.

    From the top 5 successes/improvements, decide what are the "take home messages" that would be useful to note in the future, and add these to the "Postmortem Take Home Messages" notebook: https://phet.unfuddle.com/a#/projects/9404/notebooks/17977/pages/105330/latest

    Create Unfuddle tickets for action items.
